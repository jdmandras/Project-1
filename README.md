- Limitations

This data analysis project incorporates datasets from various resources, which introduces certain limitations that should be considered.

Data pulled from varioous different sources.
Firstly, the accuracy and reliability of the analysis heavily rely on the quality and consistency of the individual datasets used. In cases where the datasets have inconsistencies, errors, or missing values, the resulting analysis may be affected. Additionally, since the datasets are sourced from different resources, there might be variations in the data collection methodologies, definitions, or timeframes employed. 

Scope and Context.
The scope and context of the data analysis should be carefully considered. Analyzing a specific dataset within a limited timeframe or narrow context may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon being studied. The findings may not be applicable or generalizable to different contexts or time periods.

Data Interpretation and Bias.
Interpreting data requires human judgment and subjectivity. Different analysts may interpret the same data differently, leading to variations in conclusions and insights. Bias or preconceived notions can influence the interpretation process. In addition, data privacy and access restrictions may limit the inclusion of certain datasets, potentially leading to an incomplete analysis. It is essential to be mindful of these limitations and consider them when interpreting the results and making decisions based on the findings of this analysis.

Evolving nature of Data.
Finally, data is not static and can change over time. Analyzing historical data may not accurately reflect current trends or future predictions. Updating the analysis with new data or accounting for data evolution is important to maintain relevance.
